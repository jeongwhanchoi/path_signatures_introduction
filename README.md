# A Brief Introduction to Path Signatures
A Jupyter notebook which provides a brief introduction to path signatures for machine learning practitioners.

# Requirements
The notebook is implemented in Python 3.7. The list of Python package dependencies is defined in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). A typical process for installing the package dependencies involves creating a new Python virtual environment and then inside the environment executing

    pip install -r requirements.txt

As an alternative to running the notebook locally, it is possible to use Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pafoster/path_signatures_introduction/master)

NB: This branch contains material for presentation using RISE. Please see the master branch for a notebook which contains a fully written-up version of this material.
